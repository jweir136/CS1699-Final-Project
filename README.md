# CS1699-Final-Project

This is the code used to get the result for our final project. We our project didn't require a lot of code, mostly just reading various files.

## Files

- <i>hate_speech_first_100.txt and hate_speech_responses.txt</i> These are the files containing our custom Alexa questions and responses.

- <i>HateSpeechTerms.txt</i> List of words and phrases linked to hate speech. Ended up not being used.

- <i>MeTooCorpus.csv</i> The data used by the #MeToo Alexa paper. The data is used as our baseline model.

- <i>MeTooCorpusAnalysis.ipynb</i> My notebook used to read and analyze the baseline data.

- <i>our-data-analysis.ipynb</i> My notebook analyzing the results of our own data.

Any other files were not used in our research, however, were still included as they were once going to be used, but were found to not be needed.
