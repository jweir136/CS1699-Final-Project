# CS1699-Final-Project

This is the code used to get the result for our final project. We our project didn't require a lot of code, mostly just reading various files.

## Files

- <i>hate_speech_first_100.txt and hate_speech_responses.txt</i> These are the files containing our custom Alexa questions and responses.

- <i>HateSpeechTerms.txt</i> List of words and phrases linked to hate speech. Ended up not being used.

- <i>MeTooCorpus.csv</i> The data used by the #MeToo Alexa paper. The data is used as our baseline model.

- <i>MeTooCorpusAnalysis.ipynb</i> My notebook used to read and analyze the baseline data.

- <i>our-data-analysis.ipynb</i> My notebook analyzing the results of our own data.
