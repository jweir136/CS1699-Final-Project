# CS1699-Final-Project

This is the code used to get the result for our final project. We our project didn't require a lot of code, mostly just reading various files.

## Files

<b>hate_speech_first_100.txt and hate_speech_responses.txt</b> These are the files containing our custom Alexa questions and responses.
<b>HateSpeechTerms.txt</b> List of words and phrases linked to hate speech. Ended up not being used.
<b>MeTooCorpus.csv</b> The data used by the #MeToo Alexa paper. The data is used as our baseline model.
<b>MeTooCorpusAnalysis.ipynb</b> My notebook used to read and analyze the baseline data.
<b>our-data-analysis.ipynb</b> My notebook analyzing the results of our own data.
